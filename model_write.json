        "email_body": "What's on my mind\n\nThis week has propelled us closer to the goal of achieving that elusive product-market fit, a milestone critical for our growth and sustainability. We've been rigorously iterating based on the market feedback, and I'm confident that we're on the right track. Our focus has been dual-pronged: launching a self-service funnel to glean insights from user interactions, and crafting a daily engagement roadmap to ensure our users have reasons to come back every day.\n\nFeedback from our website indicated some confusion about what our product offers and highlighted the need for more qualified traffic sources. It's clear we need to refine our messaging and perhaps reevaluate our user acquisition channels to ensure we're attracting the right audience. This feedback is invaluable, and we're already brainstorming ways to address these issues.\n\nOn a brighter note, the testing phase for our Oodles game has garnered positive feedback, although we've hit a snag with some technical issues. It's imperative we iron these out swiftly to capitalize on the game's potential to boost user engagement. \n\nWe're also experimenting with rapid prototyping for new daily engagement concepts, such as the \"Would you rather\" ice breaker game. These initiatives are all about enhancing user interaction and making sure there's always something new and engaging on the horizon for our users.\n\nMoving forward, here's the plan:\n- Implement changes to the website to alleviate user confusion and improve our traffic quality. This is priority one.\n- Work closely with the technical team to resolve the issues plaguing the Oodles game. We need to ensure a seamless user experience to fully leverage its engagement potential.\n- Initiate user testing and feedback sessions for our new engagement concepts. It\u2019s crucial we validate their appeal and effectiveness to ensure we're investing in features that genuinely enhance daily engagement.\n\nI'll be keeping a close eye on our metrics related to website traffic, user engagement, and conversion rates to measure the impact of our efforts. It's a time of rapid iteration and adaptation, and I'm energized by the challenges and opportunities ahead.\n\nLet's keep pushing boundaries and innovating to meet our users' needs and expectations. The journey to product-market fit is a marathon, not a sprint, and every step forward is a step in the right direction.\n\nStay agile,\n[Your Name]"

        "email_body": "What's on my mind\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s been a shift in how we\u2019re talking about getting to the \u201cdelight\u201d\r\nmoment with customers.\r\n\r\nLast week we were saying we need to get 10 founding customers and just\r\niterate with them. We were leaving out a key asset, we are our own target\r\ncustomer. In addition to the customer strategy, we can quickly iterate\r\nthere ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe have to ship our playspace first experience, which we hope to have live\r\nin Alpha form this week.\r\n\r\nThen we\u2019re having a hackathon next week, we\u2019re going to crank on this until\r\nit\u2019s fun FOR US. We\u2019re also meeting regularly to play other games together\r\n(it\u2019s rough work) and figure out what brings our team closer together.\r\n\r\nAlongside that Scott is taking prototypes to our existing paying customers\r\nto collect feedback starting next week.\r\n\r\nThis is a huge relief for me, the learning velocity needed to go up\r\ndramatically and I have strong confidence this will get us there.\r\n\r\nI feel the need to reiterate to everyone that we have no idea what our\r\nprice point is. We have taken a random stab in the dark with current\r\npricing; optimizing it is NOT a priority. Please do NOT mentally anchor to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWhat got done\r\n\r\nWe got our first actual cash payment from a customer this week. First $594\r\nin the bank \ud83d\ude42\r\n\r\nScott had a PPC audit that was quite revealing. His takeaways are below:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   lots of relevant modifiers that create all types of combinations of\r\n   long-tail searches (the best kinds). Virtual, remote, distributed, zoom,\r\n   games, activities, team building, groups, company, etc. Will then add the\r\n   game modifiers when have more games. Drawing, Trivia, Bingo, Scribble, etc.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   avg cpc is about $4.50 so the math doesn't feel crazy at 2.5% to 10%\r\n   call conversion to muster up more calls.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   not surprisingly, traffic volume trends are going down as some % of\r\n   teams go back into the office.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe biggest competitor for these keywords was Confetti\r\n<https:\/\/www.withconfetti.com\/>. This means they likely have figured\r\nsomething out and we are watching them closely.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a screenshot:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had a customer back out of payment. They are a good friend of Scott and\r\nclaimed financial distress leading to a full freeze on expenses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsao\u2019s product roadmap:\r\n",

        "email_body": "What\u2019s on my mind\r\n\r\nThis week, we've had the whole team back in the office, with Thomas returning from paternity leave and others from their vacations. There's a palpable sense of eagerness to dive back into work, and our focus is sharp on shipping chat and AI NPC integrations to foster social engagement. The aim is to cultivate not just a temporary spike in retention but a sustained, meaningful connection with our users over time.\r\n\r\nWe're looking at chat as more than a mere feature; it's the foundation for a vibrant community presence. AI NPCs will play a crucial role in setting the tone for the kind of interactions we want to encourage. Following the chat rollout, we're planning to introduce emotes, reactions, and persistent identities through avatars. The idea is to create a sense of belonging and identity both in-game and on the homepage, where users can witness ongoing games and feel the pulse of the community.\r\n\r\nWe're also contemplating how to visually represent the social graph, making weak and strong connections distinguishable, perhaps through color coding or opacity changes. This visual cue should enhance the awareness of a persistent social network within our design.\r\n\r\nAnother critical aspect we're honing in on is the tracking of progress over time. Users have expressed a strong desire to see their improvement, and while we don't have a concrete plan for this yet, it's high on our priority list. We're committed to leading into this area soon.\r\n\r\nOn the user acquisition front, we've shifted to spending only two days a week to acquire users. This change allows us to focus on weekly cohort data, which is more indicative of our progress and also more cost-effective.\r\n\r\nNext week, I'm looking forward to a half-day session with Andrew and Isao. We'll be discussing our product strategy through the lens of our business model. It's crucial to align our product development with our monetization strategy, even though we're not looking to monetize immediately. This alignment will help us maintain focus and urgency on the right things.\r\n\r\nWe're also placing a strong emphasis on influencers, community, and word-of-mouth in our growth strategy. These elements are not just part of our growth strategy but are expected to be the enduring force behind it. We're considering intentional actions to drive this, like posting summaries of influencer gameplay to foster engagement.\r\n\r\nAs we think about our path to Series A, the key is to prove that we can attract and retain the poker-curious audience. This group represents a significant market opportunity, and our success hinges on our ability to engage and monetize them.\r\n\r\nHappy new year, excited to build with y\u2019all in 2024\r\n\r\n\r\nAmir Elaguizy\r\nJanitor\r\nPoker Skill\r\n\r\n",

        "email_body": "I'm breaking my 1 page rule with this update but I got really excited.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat's on my mind.\r\n\r\nThis felt like a great week. The leadership team is concluding that startup\r\nteams are very excited about what we\u2019re building. We\u2019ve spoken to ~ ten\r\nstartups in the 5-100 employee range, and all are hungry and willing to\r\npay. It\u2019s clear to us that we could start charging them now. Which is to\r\nsay, we should and will soon.\r\n\r\nThe product strategy implications are evident, which feels great.  I\u2019m glad\r\nwe took the time to be thoughtful about this, although three weeks feels\r\nlike basically eternity to me.\r\n\r\nSome things we see with these startup teams:\r\n\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Success to them is measurable team engagement. Actual usage is what will\r\n   matter. They are buying engagement.\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   $5-$10\/seat is what they seem to view as \u201creasonable\u201d (comping with\r\n   slack in some cases)\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Progressive about culture and remote work is a foregone conclusion\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Seeing the product is what makes them get it. There is a clear \u201caha\u201d\r\n   moment when they sit down at the table to play\r\n   -\r\n\r\n   Poker in the absence of other games, is definitely pushing us into the\r\n   \u201cengineering team\u201d bucket. Even when explained through the lens of team\r\n   engagement, people still expect poker to be about gambling\r\n\r\n\r\nOne soft signal that I have seen before (with Cratejoy) is that we had\r\nearly customer pitches turn into \u201ccan I invest?\u201d questions. This means it\u2019s\r\nsomething people really want.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve attached a SUPER DUPER WIP working document that we\u2019re putting notes\r\nin around the customer. This is entirely qualitative at the moment, very\r\nfeel based from our calls.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m starting to feel out a Head of Product role. I\u2019ve floated this with a\r\nfew of you and gotten edits. I\u2019m going to keep talking to as many smart\r\npeople as I can to build a list of companies to hire from, as well as some\r\nmore thoughtful attributes for the right hire. This will be an extremely\r\nhigh-leverage hire but easy to screw up as well. Early applications on LI\r\nencourage me. There is a lot of talent out there right now:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/jobs\/view\/3429978798\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we got done this week\r\n\r\nScott started doing outreach to YC startups in the 10-100 employee range\r\nand we took a bunch of calls, more scheduled in coming weeks. This was huge\r\nto help pull me out of the weeds, thanks Scott.\r\n\r\nIsao and team started getting real results on the virtual goods survey.\r\nResponse rate is in the 2% range which feels low. The result themselves are\r\npretty encouraging though. It seems like there\u2019s a mechanic here that can\r\nbe applied onto our primary strategy, but it doesn\u2019t feel like the primary\r\nmonetization mechanic.\r\n",

        "email_body": "What's on my mind\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had a state of the union GP meeting this week. The key discussion items\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n   1.\r\n\r\n   A paying customer is not necessarily a useful customer for finding PMF.\r\n   We want FOUNDING customers. These are those who are excited about the\r\n   potential, interested in helping, will jump on a call in a heartbeat. Those\r\n   are the ones that can help us iterate quickly.\r\n   2.\r\n\r\n   We are closing accounts, sure - but none of us feel like we\u2019re on a path\r\n   to actually delight the customers we are closing. In other words, if it\u2019s\r\n   not a \u201cfuck yes\u201d, it\u2019s a no. Right now nobody feels like a \u201cfuck yes.\u201d We\r\n   wow them with our first game, and then after that we can viscerally feel\r\n   the excitement drop off. It would be easy to say \u201cwe just need more games\u201d\r\n   but we don\u2019t think thats the only answer, there are a ton of little new\r\n   things that could spice up the interactions. A simple example - ice breaker\r\n   questions during game play.\r\n   3.\r\n\r\n   The playspace first + game 2 direction feels correct but we don\u2019t have\r\n   enough insight into the path to release, it\u2019s been an R&D lead experiment\r\n   that Isao has personally been building. We need to break this down and find\r\n   a path to validate this and capture its value with customers sooner rather\r\n   than later.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result we\u2019re doing the following things:\r\n\r\n   1.\r\n\r\n   Reframe our 10 customer goal to 10 FOUNDING customers, meaning we\u2019ll\r\n   have more than 10 paying customers. Right now, we think 1 of our 5 paying\r\n   customers fits this mold. We\u2019ll get better at finding them over time. This\r\n   implies we need more of a funnel than we have stood up - as we had just\r\n   enough outreach to hit our goal, now we need more.\r\n   2.\r\n\r\n   Aggressively focusing on running customer delight experiments. Every\r\n   interaction, we want to try something new and exciting, and we want to\r\n   increase the number of these interactions\r\n   3.\r\n\r\n   Building a roadmap to release playspace + game 2. Isao is giving us a\r\n   draft of this to review next week. We believe there may be shortcuts to get\r\n   there faster, such as simply having all new customers go onto the new\r\n   experience and not worrying about bringing the existing tech along.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we got done\r\n\r\nReframed growth playbook with new goals from above:\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m bringing on a contractor (Mike) to help with product experimentation\r\nvelocity. The rough spec for the agreement and Mike\u2019s very unique resume\r\nare attached. All of the cofounders have met him and we\u2019re in alignment on\r\ntrying him out as a consultant.\r\n\r\nScott closed our 5th paying customer: Mio - 70 people.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne cool thing about this close is seeing the internal champion use our\r\ncontent from our blog:\r\n\r\n\r\nCreating a customer-obsessed culture\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve started doing weekly whole-company reviews of every single customer.\r\nDiscuss where they sit, their pain points, and how we can delight them.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach Monday, we kick off for the week with a deep dive into a customer,\r\nincluding customer videos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re doing a weekly deep dive with the team into anything remotely\r\ncompetitive or we can learn from.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMetrics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmir\u2019s shattered 5th metatarsal left foot X-ray\r\n\r\nThis feels relevant.\r\n\r\n[image: IMG_6258.jpg]\r\n",

It helps us prioritize our product roadmap more\r\neffectively. Imagine ads as a way to skip ahead in the book to read the\r\nlast page; it tells us which features to build next. This capability is\r\nshaping up well, and more importantly to me - the whole team is super\r\nengaged in this strategy.\r\n\r\nWhile we're making strides in technology, the ad landscape is putting us\r\nthrough a trial by fire. Facebook has been less than cooperative, locking\r\nour accounts and capping our daily spending to a meager $50. If anyone has\r\nany ideas or contacts that could help us clear this hurdle, your input\r\nwould be invaluable. Google just approved our account, and we\u2019re going to\r\nput some ads live next week.\r\n\r\nOur Prospect Pete campaign, featuring DALL-E generated images, is ready to\r\nroll.

        "email_body": "What\u2019s on my mind\r\n\r\nI lost four days of work to COVID but the team kept on trucking!\r\n\r\nOur rebrand is going to go live on pokerskill.com Friday afternoon, take a\r\npeek when you get a chance. It is a very differentiated brand designed to\r\nbring folks who are poker curious closer to us.\r\n\r\nNow that our funnel is working we are focusing on retention. We've seen an\r\nunoptimized Day 1 retention of roughly 10 to 11%, but I've set our internal\r\ngoal at 35% which I believe is achievable especially given that we\u2019ve not\r\ndone much against it yet.\r\n\r\nWorking on the funnel also affects retention, so we\u2019re moving to increase\r\nengagement before users even get to us by testing playable ad units on\r\nFacebook. This is something I\u2019m excited about especially because Facebook\r\nis a source of cheap clicks, increasing the results here will be worth a\r\nlot to us.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned before we have a bunch of new features about to go live. In\r\ngame chat is in development. Bots are likely to go live next week which\r\nmeans everyone who comes through the funnel has someone to play with. They\r\naren\u2019t great yet, but a basis for iteration.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re also going to start working on our real-time coaching features via\r\nLLM which is highly differentiated.\r\n\r\nAs I go deeper into go to market I\u2019m realizing that traditional marketing\r\nstrategies (such as SEO) are largely colonized by the existing real money\r\ngambling industry. We\u2019re going to be doing long tail SEO work as a work\r\nstream, but its not going to get us where we want to go.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m working on building a community based go to market strategy. We\u2019ll be\r\nleaning on our orthogonal message about poker being a fun, skill based\r\nsocial game that should be accessible to everyone.\r\n\r\nWe released our first video welcome to the vision recorded by me,\r\npurposefully low fidelity to start to create a community of true believers.\r\nI\u2019m going deeper on developing a strategy to partner with influencers, and\r\nI\u2019m going to be building a reputation personally on major poker communities\r\n(such as r\/poker).\r\n\r\nThis is starting to come into focus as part of a broader go to market\r\nstrategy that is bigger than simply UA, and I\u2019m running ahead of the team\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIsao and I have also started early discussions on what it looks like to\r\ntest monetization. Nathan has started building a cohort growth model that\r\nwe\u2019re putting early actuals in and will help us understand the growth curve\r\nand economics of the business as we validate more going forward.\r\n\r\nA couple quick insights from our UA work:\r\n\r\n\u201cFree online poker, no download\u201d style google ads gets us an e-mail for\r\n$3.46 in south east asia, with a conversion rate of about 27%\r\n\r\n\u201cPlay with friends\u201d gets us an e-mail for $9.95 with an 8% conversion rate.\r\n\r\nOur best results on FB are actually coming from FB Audience network, e.g.\r\nthird party in app ads. Likely existing gaming inventory.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re pushing live a survey next week of retained users looking to\r\nunderstand more about their goals, what brought them in, and where they get\r\ninformation about poker. This will help us both with product roadmap and\r\ntargeting UA.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m starting to get really excited about being able to build a more\r\nholistic go to market strategy than simply run ads in parallel to the team\r\nbuilding out the retention features.\r\n\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nAmir Elaguizy\r\n\r\nPoker Skill <https:\/\/pokerskill.com>\r\n\r\nJanitor\r\n",

        "email_body": "What's on my mind\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst good news Eric Seufert <https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/ericseufert\/> has\r\njoined as an advisor, check out his LinkedIn. He\u2019s already been massively\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\nBig shoutout to everyone who helped us navigate the Facebook ad approval\r\nlabyrinth, especially Eric. Thanks to his connections, we got our account\r\napproved and the advertising budget lifted from $50 to $350 a day. So,\r\nwe're in business.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, we accidentally (read: Amir accidentally) spent our expanded\r\nbudget on mobile ads yesterday and hit some impressive traffic numbers.\r\nYes, it exposed some bugs but also opened our eyes to the potential in\r\nmobile. We found our CPC on mobile is staggeringly low at 1.8 cents\r\ncompared to 20 cents on the web. So, mobile, you have our attention now.\r\n\r\nGoogle approval also came through for us. But a word of caution\u2014approval\r\nfeels like a relationship rather than a status with both Facebook and\r\nGoogle. We're in for a long-term job of account management given our\r\nassociation with poker, even though we're neither a social casino nor\r\ngambling platform. Traffic and data are flowing though.\r\n\r\nThe initiative to shift our thinking from \u201cengineering\u201d and \u201cmarketing\u201d to\r\njust \u201cgrowth\u201d is going quite well. We're beginning to view advertising as a\r\npart of our product experience, and that shift is empowering for us as a\r\nteam. It has produced engagement levels we've never seen before. It's one\r\nof the most rewarding aspects of being in this early stage of business.\r\n\r\nAt our last board meeting, I highlighted three goals: debug our funnel,\r\nunderstand our audience, and execute branded domain testing. We're almost\r\nthere with the funnel, making good progress despite ad delays. The domain\r\ntesting ad unit went live last night (stay tuned).\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re getting good data now on our Prospect Pete persona, along side\r\nStrategy Steve.\r\n\r\nSoon, we will introduce new features like bot frameworks to improve player\r\nliquidity and real-time advice tables, which tie into our educational\r\ncomponent.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m excited now to spend all weekend playing with ad units ;)\r\n\r\n\r\nps. Attached is the product sync deck we're iterating on, you can see how\r\nmetrics and instrumentation are progressing. We review this with the whole\r\nteam.\r\n",

        "email_body": "*Whats on my mind * We've started to draw strong conclusions about the\r\ndirection we need to move in from here. Some of them are counterintuitive\r\nand represent a return to our prior thinking. There's a lot behind all of\r\nthis but I'll just summarize at the highest level.\r\n\r\nSome of the conclusions I\u2019ve drawn from the last few weeks of intense focus\r\nand discussion, along with some 360-feedback from Andrew @ Transcend (thank\r\nyou):\r\n\r\n\r\n   1.\r\n\r\n   Our primary persona is Strategy Steve, secondary focus on Puzzle Paul.\r\n   This is counterintuitive because originally Butterfly Bella and Party Game\r\n   felt like the path. The problem with them is we don\u2019t intuitively know them\r\n   extremely well and we\u2019re guessing as to how to delight them.\r\n   2.\r\n\r\n   I\u2019m focusing the team back on what we know well, rather than continuing\r\n   to experiment broadly. We need to get back to something we have strong\r\n   intuition & conviction around, and exploring a variety of different games\r\n   in a space we don\u2019t know like the back of our hand is not going to get us\r\n   to any form of PMF anytime soon. That means back to Poker as our primary\r\n   focus.\r\n   3.\r\n\r\n   We have to build a game first, we can\u2019t start with the platform. It\u2019s\r\n   too diffuse and we\u2019re getting a lot of people who are mildly interested but\r\n   very few people that are rabid. We did have rabid fans back when we were\r\n   purely focused on poker. We need this before we can become a platform.\r\n   4.\r\n\r\n   We need continuous user acquisition. The sales model of small amounts of\r\n   feedback here and there is NOT going to get us to FUN, and the ACV isn\u2019t\r\n   high enough to allow us to focus deeply on one customer's needs at a time.\r\n   We have to build something that delights a core group and we need signal\r\n   against that continuously.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m now investigating the community strategy and business model of chess.com\r\nas a way we can both build togetherness and focus on a single game at first\r\n(Poker).\r\n\r\nWe\u2019ve had our first set of target customer interviews (100% match for\r\nStrategy Steve persona) and confirmed a lot of my theories, but more\r\nimportantly confirmed that this persona also plays: competitive chess,\r\nbackgammon, Uno (who knew), hearts and others. He also plays them mostly\r\nwith friends and family.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re getting back to what we know and it feels extremely right, stay tuned\r\nfor specifics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. **Strategy Steve (Gen Z, age 20-24):**\r\n\r\n   - *Description*: Steve is a business analyst who loves games that\r\ninvolve strategy and decision making. He enjoys the competitive nature of\r\nstrategy games.\r\n\r\n   - *Game Preferences*: Risk, Chess, Settlers of Catan.\r\n\r\n   - *Value Proposition*: Complex and strategic games that test\r\ndecision-making skills in a competitive environment.\r\n\r\n   - *Potential Features*: Strategy games, leaderboards, matchmaking based\r\non skill level, real-time play.\r\n\r\n   - *Growth Attributes*: Inviting Friends (High), Group Play (High),\r\nSocial Sharing (Medium), Frequency of Play (High), Retention Rate (High),\r\nMonetization Potential (High), Influence (Medium)\r\n\r\n   - *Community Engagement*: Medium\r\n\r\n   - *Growth Contribution Potential*: High\r\n\r\n   - *Estimated TAM*: 12 million players\r\n\r\n   - *Priority Reasoning*: Steve has high growth attributes in terms of\r\ninviting friends, group play, and frequency of play. Given his competitive\r\nnature, he's likely to engage with others in communities around strategy\r\ngames.\r\n\r\n7. **Puzzle-loving Paul (Millennial, age 27-35):**\r\n\r\n   - *Description*: Paul is an accountant who loves to unwind with a good\r\npuzzle. He enjoys puzzle games that require focus and provide a sense of\r\naccomplishment once completed.\r\n\r\n   - *Game Preferences*: Sudoku, Crossword Puzzles, Jigsaw Puzzles.\r\n\r\n   - *Value Proposition*: Puzzle games that provide a satisfying challenge\r\nand a sense of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n   - *Potential Features*: Puzzle games, progress tracking.\r\n\r\n   - *Growth Attributes*: Inviting Friends (Low), Group Play (Low), Social\r\nSharing (Low), Frequency of Play (Low), Retention Rate (Medium),\r\nMonetization Potential (Medium), Influence (Low)\r\n\r\n   - *Community Engagement*: Low\r\n\r\n   - *Growth Contribution Potential*: Low\r\n\r\n   - *Estimated TAM*: 5 million players\r\n\r\n   - *Priority Reasoning*: Paul enjoys puzzle games and tends to focus on\r\nhis own achievement\r\n",
